# ZZZ0001 Python Basics - Random Data Generator - 15 marks
## Aim
 
* Understand how to use  functions, loops, random and libraries in programing 
* Familiarize MQTT communication protocol using paho-mqtt python library
* Understand how to setup Thingsboard dashboard
* Understand how to setup and use IDEs and development workflow
* Enhance troubleshooting ablilites without supervision

## Prerequisites

1. An IDE, we suggest that [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) be used for this assigment due to its simplicity. However, other IDE or text editors are also highly recommended: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) (my personal choice), etc... <br><br>
Seting up the development environment are part of the learning process, no guidance will be given here

2. Registered [Thingsboard](https://demo.thingsboard.io/) demo account
3. Install the [paho-mqtt](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/) library


## Suggested flow
1. Setup the development environment
2. Familiarize with python basics, here's a list of things better understood before getting started
    * Variable declaration
    * Control structure
    * Functions
    * Python arrays, lists, tuples, dictionaries
    * JSON
    * Python random library
3. Log in thingsboard, create new device and an empty dashboard
4. Research how to write a python script to send data to Thingsboard
5. Start writing


## Overview
Create a python script and thingsboard dashboard, with the python script keep publishing random data non-stop via MQTT protocol using the paho-mqtt library

## Specifications

1. 2 floating point variables shall be sent to Thingsboard, namely **Temperature** and **Humidity**<br><br>
**Temperature**: 25-35 with one decimal place (eg: 29.1, 30.2)<br>
**Humidity**: 50-100 with one decimal place (eg: 50.1, 93.2)


2. The values of the variable shall be realistic and continuous, for example a temperature of 29 should not jump to 31, instead it should increase or decrease +-0.1-0.2 continuously<br><br>
For example, 29.1 -> 29.2 -> 29.3 -> 29.2 -> 29.2<br>
and **NOT** 29.1 -> 32.2 -> 33.0 -> 29.0 -> 25.3

3. The directions temperature and humidity shall be completely random
4. The data shall be sent every one second
5. 2 **timeseries chart** and 2 **gauge** for temperature and humidity shall be present in Thingsboard
6. The **Thingsboard dashboard link** shall be set to **public**

## Submission
The **public Thingsboard dashboard link** and **python script** should be sent to the group chat.

## Grading
* Efficiency of algorithm used to generate random temperature & humidity - 5 marks
* Correct use of paho-mqtt library - 2 marks
* Syntax & formatting used in python script - 2 marks
* Polish and style of Thingsboard dashboard - 2 marks
* Amount of assistance from instructor (less assistance = higher) - 4 marks

## Documentations and Guides
A list of links to documentations will be provided below, it is highly recommended to read the **official documentation** of each and every tool, library or language used

* [Thingsboard MQTT API Reference](https://thingsboard.io/docs/reference/mqtt-api/)
* [paho-mqtt library official documentation](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/)
* [Python random library official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)
