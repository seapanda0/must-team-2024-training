# ZZZ0002_V1 NRF24 - 20 marks
## Aim
 
* Familiarize with basic RF24 communication between Raspberry Pi and Arduino
* Enhance troubleshooting ablilites without supervision

## Prerequisites

1. An IDE, we suggest that [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) be used for this assigment due to its simplicity. However, other IDE or text editors are also highly recommended: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) (the instructor personal choice), etc... <br><br>
Seting up the development environment are part of the learning process, no guidance will be given here

2. Arduino IDE with RF24 library installed

2. An Arduino/MMU sensor node and Raspberry Pi with NRF24 module connected

2. A Raspberry Pi with [RF24](https://nrf24.github.io/RF24/) library and [Python Wtapper](https://nrf24.github.io/RF24/md_docs_python_wrapper.html) installed *(already done this time by instructor, detailed installed guide will be published at a later date)*

3. An ssh client and sftp client (Windows and Linux already have clients built in into their native terminal)
4. Basic understanding of linux command line
5. Completion and understanding of ZZZ0001 assignment 

## Overview
Create a python script (run by Raspberry Pi) and a Arduino C++ code. The Arduino shall randomly generate a floating point number and unsgined 8-bit integer and send it using RF24 to the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi shall print out the data whenever it receives it.

## Suggested flow

1. Familiarize with C++ basics, here's a list of things better understood before getting started
    * C++ Struct, Arrays, Multidimensional Arrays
    * C++ bytes, byte array
    * [Python struct library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html)
    * C++ data types and sizes
    * C++/Arduino random function

3. Learn how to use [SFTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol) or any other file transfer method to put the written script on the Raspberry Pi 
4. Run [GettingStarted.ino](GettingStarted.ino) and [getting_started.py](https://nrf24.github.io/RF24/examples_linux_2getting_started_8py-example.html)
5. Run the [sendtest.ino and recievetest.py](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sTMwPcC82fkH5zAIRUYqY2MQlSKD_1Gc?usp=sharing) written by instructor
4. Study the files
5. Start writing

## Specifications

1. **1 floating point variable** and **1 unsgined 8-bit integer** shall be sent from the Arduino to the Raspberry Pi. The value of them shall be randomly generated by the Arduino

2. The sending interval should be every 1 second

3. The CE and CSN pin on the Raspberry Pi and MMU Sensor Node is as follows. If an Arduino is used, it will depends on how you connected it

    * CE MMU Sensor Node - 9
    * CSN MMU Sensor Node - 8
    * CE Raspberry Pi - 22
    * CSN Raspberry Pi - 0

## Submission
The **.ino** file and **Python script** shall be sent to the instructor.

## Grading
* Correct use of RF24 library (Python) - 5 marks
* Correct use of RF24 library (Arduino) - 5 marks
* Syntax & formatting (Python) - 2 marks
* Syntax & formatting (C++)  - 2 marks
* Use of correct data types - 2 marks
* Amount of assistance from instructor (less assistance = higher) -  4 marks

## Documentations and Guides
A list of links to documentations will be provided below, it is highly recommended to read the **official documentation** of each and every tool, library or language used

Keep in mind that that are several RF24 libraries, the author of the library chosen will be **TMRh20**

* [RF24 Library - C++](https://nrf24.github.io/RF24/index.html)
* [RF24 Library - Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/rf24/)
* [RF24 Library - All Classes (Most Important)](https://nrf24.github.io/RF24/classRF24.html)
* [pyRF24 (The syntax is slightly different, but most of the function parameters should be the same)](https://pyrf24.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rf24_api.html)
* [GettingStarted.ino](GettingStarted.ino) and [getting_started.py](https://nrf24.github.io/RF24/examples_linux_2getting_started_8py-example.html) - examples provided by official documentation
* [sendtest.ino and recievetest.py](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sTMwPcC82fkH5zAIRUYqY2MQlSKD_1Gc?usp=sharing) - written by instructor

## Hints

To troubleshoot RF24, use the [printPrettyDetails()](https://nrf24.github.io/RF24/classRF24.html#a32205b4854f595b0d32dce9c95e93ba2) function and run it on both the Arduino and Raspberry Pi to see the configuration of RF24
